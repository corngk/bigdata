# Big Data
### Big Data Resources

This guide covers what you need to learn Big Data. I use Windows 10 running with WSL 2 using Ubuntu 20.04. This article includes the following software:
1. [Hadoop 2.10.1](https://github.com/corngk/bigdata/blob/main/Hadoop.md)
2. Apache Scoop
3. Apache Spark
4. [My SQL 8](https://github.com/corngk/bigdata/blob/main/MYSQL.md)

### Summary
Congratulations! You have successfully installed all you need to learn Big Data in your Ubuntu subsystem of Windows 10. It’s relatively easier as we don’t need to download or compile/build native Hadoop libraries.

BTW, WSL is not a virtual machine however it provides you almost the same experience as you would have in a native Linux system.

Happy coding!
